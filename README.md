# DestructibleTerrain
DestructibleTerrain is a Unity project, part of a study group initiative to play around with the Unity Engine.

This project try to mimic one of the most main Worms game mechanics: destructible terrain.

Currently there's two scenes:
1. PolygonColliderApproach - uses Unity components to calculate Physics and collision;
2. ShaderMaskApproach - (WIP) a shader and collision map approach that uses a alpha masked texture to control the terrain and its modifications.

In its first iteration, the game itself only has a destructible terrain with some bugs of vector space transposition.
